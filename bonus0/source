   This is the assembly code for the main function of a program. The first instruction, 
   "push %ebp", pushes the current value of the base pointer (EBP) onto the stack.
   The next instruction, "mov %esp,%ebp", moves the current value of the stack pointer (ESP)
   into the base pointer (EBP). This sets up the stack frame for the function.

The next instruction, "and $0xfffffff0,%esp", performs a bitwise and operation 
on the stack pointer with the value 0xfffffff0. This is typically used to align
the stack pointer to a 16-byte boundary, which is required for some processor architectures.
The instruction "sub $0x40,%esp" subtracts 0x40 (64 in decimal) from the stack pointer,
allocating space on the stack for local variables.

The next instruction "lea 0x16(%esp),%eax" loads the effective address of memory 0x16 bytes
above the current stack pointer into the EAX register.

The instruction "mov %eax,(%esp)" moves the value stored in EAX into the memory location
pointed to by the current stack pointer.

Then the instruction "call 0x804851e <pp>" calls a function named "pp" located at
memory address 0x804851e.

the instruction "lea 0x16(%esp),%eax" loads the effective address of memory 0x16 bytes 
above the current stack pointer into the EAX register as before.

The instruction "mov %eax,(%esp)" moves the value stored in EAX into the memory location
pointed to by the current stack pointer as before.

Then the instruction "call 0x80483b0 puts@plt" calls a function named "puts" located
at memory address 0x80483b0. The "@plt" suffix indicates that this is a call to a procedure
linkage table entry rather than a direct call to the puts function.

The instruction "mov $0x0,%eax" moves the value 0x0 into the EAX register.

The instruction "leave" restores the stack and frame pointer to their values before 
the function was called, effectively destroying the stack frame.

The instruction "ret" returns control to the calling function.

Overall, this assembly code sets up a stack frame, calls two functions,
"pp" and "puts" and then exits the main function.





the previous code calls function pp, comment it as well
